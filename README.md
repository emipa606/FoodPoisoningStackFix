# Food poisoned meals no longer taint whole stacks


This changes the mechanism that handles food poisoned meals and how they stack. Normally, if one food poisoned meal gets put onto a stack of 9, each of the 10 total meals will have a 10% chance of causing food poisoning. I felt that was silly, and reworked it so that the number of poisoned meals in a stack is tracked, and when meals are picked up, there is a proper chance of picking up the tainted one(s).

This will make food poisoning cases feel more consistent with your cook’s skill and kitchen’s cleanliness.
